Resources are managed here.<br/>
Reources are defined in terms of their hardware and capabilities. For example, <br/>
a small boat might have a single drive motor plus a rudder, or it might have two <br/>
drives and steer by thrust differentials.  Lower level activities, such as steering <br/>
and battery monitoring, are associated with the resource.
